For my Mobile Application Security Class, we created a python script that 
1) disassembles an apk into .smali files
2) look in the AndroidManifest file to find where the packages are to find the relevant source code
3) look through all files in each relevant directory to find instances of SSL vulnerabilities such as "http://" or "proceed()"

To run:
-navigate to /apps
-use command line argument: python3 Nguyen-analyze.py <target apk> 
-the output.txt file will contain all strings making the app vulnerable
