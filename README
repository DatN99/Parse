For my Mobile Application Security Class, we had to create a python script that 
1) disassembles an apk into .smali files
2) look in the AndroidManifest file to find where the packages are to find the relevant source code
3) look through all files in each relevant directory to find instances of SSL vulnerabilities 

To run:
-navigate to /apps
-use command line argument: python3 Nguyen-analyze.py <target apk>
